		<h1>SINGAPORE</h1>
         
        <p>Singapore is where I feel most at home. I moved there when I was five and stayed until I was 18, before heading to New York for college. The city, with its vibrant blend of cultures, has shaped me in countless ways. Growing up in Singapore, often called a melting pot, exposed me to a mix of Chinese, Malay, Indian, and Western influences, enriching my worldview and giving me a deep appreciation for diversity. My fondest memories were made here, and it’s where my parents still live, keeping it as the anchor of my life. Over the years, I’ve had the opportunity to meet my best friends and build relationships that have become like family. Singapore gave me the space to grow, to form my support system, and to discover who I am. The people, the food, the streets—all of it feels safe and familiar, a true home. While I’ve lived in other cities, Singapore remains the one place that always feels like home, where my roots are deepest, and where I know I’ll always be welcome.</p>

                <td>Classes</td>
                <td>Growing up, my parents enrolled me in various classes—piano, in-line skating, Kumon, swimming, art, Bharatnatyam, Mandarin, and chess. While I enjoyed some more than others, each has shaped my interests over time. I now love dancing, and my early Bharatnatyam lessons contributed to that. Art classes pushed me toward visual art in high school and later, communication design in college. Learning Mandarin helped me immerse in Singaporean culture and expanded my perspective, allowing me to speak four languages today.

                <td>Going down to play in the apartment playground</td>
                <td>Every day after school until about 8th grade, I would have a quick snack and head down to the playground to meet my friends. We’d play games like Cops and Robbers and What's the Time Mr. Wolf, or simply hang out and catch up. I also learned how to waveboard, and we often had waveboard competitions, adding to the fun. We stayed out until dinner time, and then we’d all head home to eat with our families. These playground sessions not only brought joy but also helped me build strong relationships, with some friendships becoming the best connections of my life.

                <td>School Trips</td>
                <td>Attending an international school in Singapore and growing up in Southeast Asia gave me incredible opportunities to explore the region. Through school, I was able to visit places like Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia, where we went hiking, trekking, rafting, and camping. These trips became some of my fondest experiences, and I developed many life skills along the way, from teamwork to problem-solving, all while being immersed in nature and adventure.

                <td>Living in Singapore, away from blood-related relatives, taught me to find family in friends. I was able to build my own support system, meet my best friends, and create countless memories. Now, whenever I go back to Singapore, I have to see them—whether it’s dinners, painting sessions, or just finding ways to spend time together. Every time we all get together, it fills me with a sense of comfort and belonging, reminding me that home is as much about the people as the place.
