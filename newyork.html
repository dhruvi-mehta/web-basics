		<h1>NEW YORK</h1>
         
        <p>New York became my new adventure when I moved here at 18 for college, and now, five years later, it has started to feel like home in its own unique way. The journey wasn’t smooth—midway through my freshman year, the pandemic hit, forcing me to return to Singapore and attend online classes in the middle of the night for nearly 10 months. When I finally came back, I was able to form my core friend group, and together, we made countless memories that will last a lifetime. Living in New York gives you this strange blend of belonging and homesickness. It’s a place where you’re part of a community, but at the same time, you often long for the familiarity of home. Over time, though, the city has become more comfortable, a place I’ve grown into, especially as I navigate my twenties. This stage of life is interesting—everyone is on such different paths. Some friends are working, others are pursuing their master’s, some are getting married, and many are moving away for new opportunities. New York has seen me through it all, and slowly but surely, it’s become a place I can call my own.
