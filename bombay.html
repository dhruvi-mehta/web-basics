		<h1> BOMBAY (MUMBAI)</h1>
         
        <p>Bombay, now known as Mumbai, will always be Bombay to me. There's a sense of comfort in using the name that my parents have always called it, a name tied to their stories, memories, and the home they knew. While the city has evolved and embraced its modern identity as Mumbai, calling it Bombay feels like holding onto a piece of my family's history, a connection to the past that grounds me every time I return.I moved away from Bombay when I was just five years old, but I’ve often visited over the years. Although I don't have clear memories of living there, each visit feels like an opportunity to rediscover the city and make new memories. There's a comfort in returning to the place where my roots lie, surrounded by family and familiar landmarks. Yet, at the same time, I feel a certain disconnect—the city changes with every visit, evolving in ways I don't always recognize or relate to. It’s a bittersweet feeling, as Bombay will always be home in my heart, yet it grows distant with time.

        <h2> Things  I do everytime I visit Bombay</h2>
        <ol id="topfive">
            <li>
            <strong>Visit my paternal grandmother<i>dadi</i> :</strong> As soon as my family lands in Bombay, we head straight to my dadi's house (paternal grandmother in many Indian languages), where she always prepares the most delicious meals.
            </li> 
            <li>
            <strong>Food Staples:</strong> My family and I always crave certain staples that we can’t easily find in Singapore or, for me, here in New York. So, we always have a long list of foods we want to eat, like <i>Vada Pav</i>,<i>Bombay grill sandwich</i>, and <i>cold coffee</i> made with blended vanilla ice cream, coffee, and a hint of cardamom.
            </li>
            <li>
            <strong>Enjoy fresh coconut water straight from the tree at my grandparents' house:</strong> I love coconuts! Every time I visit Bombay, my grandmother makes sure someone gets fresh coconuts from the tree and cuts them up for us to enjoy. It's so refreshing, especially on those warmer days!</li>
            <li>
                <strong>Sitting in a rickshaw:</strong> One of my favorite ways to experience the city, with the wind in my hair, the hustle of the streets around me, and the sights of Bombay passing by.
            </li>
            <li>
            <strong>Coffee date with one of my favorite cousins:</strong> One of my cousins and I are really close, and over the years we’ve started this tradition of meeting super early in the morning to walk by the water at Bandstand and grab coffee afterward. I love our morning hangouts because it’s so calm and quiet, and it’s the best time to catch up and just be together.
            </li>
