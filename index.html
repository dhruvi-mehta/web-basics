        <div class="description">
            <p> As a third culture kid, my idea of "home" has constantly shifted. I spent my early years in Mumbai, India, before moving to Singapore when I was five years old for 13 years, where I embraced a mix of cultures that shaped my identity. Then came five years in New York, where the city's diversity felt both familiar and eye-opening. Each place has shaped me in different ways—Mumbai gave me my roots, Singapore my growth, and New York City my independence. Now, "home" is no longer a single place, but a collection of experiences from each. Click on each window and join me to see how each place—Mumbai, Singapore, and New York—has left its mark on my identity and my evolving understanding of "home."
